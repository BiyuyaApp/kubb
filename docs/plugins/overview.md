# Plugins

Plugins are a great way to extend Kubb's basic functionality. Even the package `@kubb/core` is a plugin, which also contains the building blocks in creating your own plugin. We have already written some plugins so you can easily get started with TypeScript or ReactQuery.

::: tip
Do you have an idea or a specific change is needed, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/kubb-project/kubb/issues/new/choose">create an issue</a>.

<hr/>

Our plugin system is based on some ideas of the following packages:

- [Rollup's](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/blob/master/docs/05-plugin-development.md)
- [Unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin)
- [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/guides/plugins)
