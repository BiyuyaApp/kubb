# @kubb/ts-codegen

This library contains the building blocks that can be used to create TypeScript code. It's all based on TypeScript AST(a API of the TypeScript team to create different nodes).

A good tool to visualize what AST is can be found on [TypeScript AST Viewer](https://ts-ast-viewer.com/#), here you can paste in some TypeScript code and the tool will show you what the AST will be.

To get started with TypeScript AST, I would suggest following this tutorial: [Generating Typescript using AST's](https://nabeelvalley.co.za/docs/javascript/typescript-ast/).

<hr/>

This library contains also the logic to `print` the nodes(convert AST to string) and it also hase the functionality to generate `index.ts` files based on a folder structure(see `writeIndexes`).
